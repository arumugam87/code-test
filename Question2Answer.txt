What about the codebase scales well? What doesnt scale well and limits flexibility?
1. Create 50 Vnet, Manually creates take more time, So better create using Terraform.
2. It can easily create using Terraform Module. 
3. Without Module, It's not good idea crate multiple Vnet without using Terraform Module. That's not good idea.

How would you structure the codebase to enable CI/CD pipelines to be added and run in a managable configuration?
1. We can use CI/CD pipeline is really best option.
2. We can use store sensitive data in the variable in CI Tool. Eg. Azure DevOps Parameter Store.
3. We can track the changes and roll back the changes if needed. 

Does the requirement for multiple Azure regions affect the way you structure the codebase?
Need VNet Peering or VPN Gateway for multiple Azure Regions connecitivity.
